A Nagios plugin for Mattermost. Supports Nagios Core >= 4.4.x.

## About

This plugin allows you to

- [x] get logs to specific systems without leaving the Mattermost
    - get alerts and notifications instantly delivered, resembling the `showlog.cgi` UI
- [x] receive system monitoring reports on a subscribed channel
    - you will be frequently informed which hosts and/or services have abnormal state
- [ ] (in progress) receive notifications about changes to configuration on a subscribed channel
    - anytime a change has been made to Nagios configuration, you will receive a diff between the old and the new version

Ultimately, this will make you or your team more productive and make the experience with Nagios smoother.
