# Contributing to this project

This repository uses the [mattermost-plugin-starter-template](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-starter-template). Therefore, developing this plugin is roughly the same as it is with every plugin using the template.
All the necessary steps to develop are in the template's repository.

### Developing the watcher

To build the watcher, you can use the following command:

```shell script
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/watcherX.Y.Z.linux-amd64 -a -v cmd/watcher/main.go
```

Of course, you can build the watcher for other operating systems and architectures too.

## I saw a bug, I have a feature request or a suggestion

Please file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-nagios/issues), it will be very useful!

## Development

Pull Requests are welcome! You can contact us on the [Mattermost Community ~Plugin: Nagios channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/plugin-nagios).

This plugin only contains a server portion. Read our documentation about the [Developer Workflow](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/developer-workflow/) and [Developer Setup](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/developer-setup/) for more information about developing and extending plugins.

To avoid having to manually install your plugin, build and deploy your plugin using one of the following options.

### Deploying with Local Mode

If your Mattermost server is running locally, you can enable [local mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html#local-mode) to streamline deploying your plugin. After configuring it, just run:

```shell script
make deploy
```

### Deploying with credentials

Alternatively, you can authenticate with the server's API with a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):

```shell script
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```
